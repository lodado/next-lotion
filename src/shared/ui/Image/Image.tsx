/**
 * `Image` is a wrapper component around Next.js's `Image` component,
 * designed to simplify the handling of image sources, typically from Storage,
 * but it can be used with any image URL. It provides a way to include images in your application
 * with default dimensions or customized ones.
 *
 * Props:
 * - `src` (string): The source URL of the image. It is a required prop to display the image.
 * - `alt` (string): Textual description of the image for accessibility purposes. Also required.
 * - `width` (number, optional): The width of the image in pixels. Defaults to 500 if not specified.
 * - `height` (number, optional): The height of the image in pixels. Defaults to 500 if not specified.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```jsx
 * <Image
 *   src="https://example.com/path/to/image.jpg"
 *   alt="Descriptive text for the image"
 *   width={640}
 *   height={480}
 * />
 * ```
